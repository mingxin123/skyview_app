![Alt text](/skyview_app/SkyView.png?raw=true "Optional Title")

Description:

Created an interactive sky chart that displays the positions of stars, planets, and deep sky objects for a given position and time. Provided some basic knowledge of astronomy, some trigonometry. 

For stars, took an existing star database and displayed the brightest stars as white points on a black circle. Star brightness is expressed using a quantity called magnitude whose value gets bigger as the star is dimmer. The brightest stars in the night sky have a negative magnitude (about -1.5 for Sirius) and magnitudes greater than 6 are generally not visible to the naked eye.

Constellations typically denote collections of stars that vaguely represent some object or mythological creature. Today, there are 88 constellations recognized in the sky (including both the northern and southern hemispheres). Constellations now not only represent the shapes, but regions of the sky which contain objects and stars not part of the traditional shape. Used a database of constellation line endpoints, drawn a line connecting the bright stars that form constellations.

"WoW" Factors:

Display the night sky as a window-filling black circle, with stars over magnitude 6 as small circles or points, constellation lines connecting them, the position of the sun, the moon, the eight planets, and the Messier Catalog deep sky objects.

Display the moon’s actual phase. 

Keep updating the sky in real time, animating it so that it is correct; and animation to the past or future.

Allow the user to pick their location, set the time of interest (defaulting to now), and display the objects.

Allow the user to “zoom in” to a region of space and see more objects in that location. 

Allow stars, constellations, deep sky objects to have their names displayed as labels.
